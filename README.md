<h1>How to deploy a website on multiple EC2 instances using Ansible</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Ansible is a powerful open-source IT automation tool for IT infrastructure management. It allows you to automate repetitive tasks, manage configurations, deploy applications, and orchestrate complex workflows. 
In this project I will be demonstrating how I used Ansible to deploy a website on multiple EC2 instances.

<h2>Learning Outcome</h2>
From completing this project I was  able to understand how Azure Sentinel works and the benefits from using it in your environment.

Azure Sentinel is a scalable, cloud-native security information event management (SIEM) and security orchestration automated response (SOAR) solution. 
Azure Sentinel collects data from different data sources, performs data correlation, data visualization and processed the data in a single dashboard. It helps to collect, detect, investigate and respond to security threats and incidents.
